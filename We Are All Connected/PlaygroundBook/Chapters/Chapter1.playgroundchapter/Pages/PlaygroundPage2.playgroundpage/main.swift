The World is a Entire Living Thing
==================================
 
Now you will receive a special magnifier ðŸ”Ž that will help you see how our system works in different scales, continuous interacting with it's environment, and making unique connections. More information about the connection you can find in your apple watch integrated with the magnifier.
 
As you see aside, there is a bunch of connections in our world and one is intrisict dependent of the other: atoms form elements that turn into molecules that structured form into vegetal cells that structure the trees. There is no start point or end point for the observation. We literally could observe in a smaller scale than an atom size if we have equipment, the same is valid for bigger scales.

There is a quote from Fullmetal Alchemist, an anime ( yes... I am an otaku ðŸ˜¬ ),
that explains this connection condition in a way that could`t be better:

 * Callout(Quote): Everything is in a great flow, I don't know if this flow should be called the universe or world, but from that point of view, you and me, we are like ants. A small individual in a stream. We are only "one" in "everything", but only with these "ones" together, "everything" can exist.
