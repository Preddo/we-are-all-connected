> The magnifier metaphor I just used is very fantasy-like however represents our world. In fact, our perception will always be limited by our senses, our world still has a lot of  mysteries to be solved and it always gets me excited. As **William Blake** once said 🗣: *“If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, Infinite.”*. Thanks!
