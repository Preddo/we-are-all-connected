It Lives no Matter What
=======================
 In this page you will observe that the whole system go towards an equilibrium state. The name of this self organization mechanism is co-evolution, it`s totally driven by the criativity of the mutations

 One mutation in a cell can generate different behaviors in our body, in our case a bunch of mutations turn us from archaic homo sapiens to homo sapiens sapiens, our current species. But mutations it's not just about DNA changes, it's about every change in our reality. There`s a lot of mutations in different scales that change our environment, i encourage you to observe the mutations around now on.
 
 In the cartesian view the whole thing it's explained by it self, but in our world it really does't work in that way as you already have seen. All the parts of this ecossystem exchange messages to each other in it's on particular way.
